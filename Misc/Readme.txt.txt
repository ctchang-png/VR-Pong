Hi! Welcome to my term project, VR PONG!

To run my file, open the file 'main.py' in a code editor. Your folder
should contain all necessary files to make the game run.

Before you run the game, you're going to need to install a few modules.
You will need: OpenCV, cmu_112_graphics, PIL, and matplotlib

Move your paddle to rally with the AI, playing best of 3 rounds.

- Controls -

To move the in game paddle, grab something bright and colorful and enter calibration mode.
Hold your object at various points on the screen, clicking it to calibrate. If there's a green
box around your object while you move it around in calibration mode, you should be set. If something goes
wrong, just press 'Space' to reset your calibration selections.

If you don't have an object or a camera, press 'm' in game to switch to mouse controls.

Press 'Space' to pause/resume
Press 'w' to win the round
Press 's' to increase score
Press 'l' to lose the round
Press 'c' to recalibrate
